# Twitter Bot
Here are 2 files in python 3describing how I set up my twitter bot.  
My bot posts one artwork a day, you can see it at @1million40.  
I compile the resources provided by three great museums, the Met, the MOMA and the Tate. They all have put their resources on github.  

The first file goes over how to get the url to get the json file where I will have informations about one work of art in particular.  
Since all museums have different format, I had to adapt, and seeing that the repos were not updated frequently I decided to clone them, and then figure out the right path
on my computer.  

The second file posts a tweet.
